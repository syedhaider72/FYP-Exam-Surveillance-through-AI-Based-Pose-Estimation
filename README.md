I developed a Smart AI-Based Cheating Detection System using YOLO v8-pose tracking for precise pose estimation. Implemented on Google Colab, the system achieved 95% accuracy and included dynamic thresholding, cheating duration counting and real-time data management, ensuring efficient monitoring and broad accessibility.
